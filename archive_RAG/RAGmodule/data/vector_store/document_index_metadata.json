Numerous successful initiatives have been developed to broaden participation in computing, for example, by combining computing majors with disciplines in which there has traditionally been greater gender diversity [ 7]. However, this surge of interest is putting pressure on resources at many insti- tutions and causing concern amongst administrators and educators [46]. A particularly challenging aspect involves delivering on-the-spot assistance when students need help. Traditional approaches, such as running scheduled office hours in which students can approach instructors and teaching assistants, are often poorly utilized [ 56].arXiv:2401.11314v2 [cs.HC] 25 Feb 2024 CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Kazemitabaar, et al.",

There is an urgent need to develop more scalable, equitable and student- friendly solutions for providing support in programming courses. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) may of- fer one solution. LLM-powered AI tools such as ChatGPT [ 48] can act as powerful coding assistants that generate code from natural language descriptions. However, the rapid growth and pervasive- ness of LLMs have raised concerns about their use in educational settings [ 26]. This has led to some institutions banning access to tools like ChatGPT [ 24]. In computing education, in particular, con- cerns have been voiced regarding issues of academic integrity and student over-reliance [ 3,30]. Indeed, research has shown that LLMs can generate direct solutions to almost any problem typical in intro- ductory programming courses [ 12,16]. To develop pedagogically effective real-time support solutions for programming courses, it is necessary to implement suitable \"guardrails\" that restrict the open-ended AI’s ability in generating direct solutions even when prompted.",

In this paper, we present CodeAid, an LLM-powered coding assistant that is designed to meet the needs of both students and educators: being helpful and technically correct, while not directly revealing code solutions. We used an iterative design approach that involved frequent requirements elicitation and feedback from the course instructor, who taught the course in which CodeAid was deployed. CodeAid allowed students to (i) ask general programming questions, (ii) ask questions about the code they provide, (iii) explain the code they provide, (iv) help fix the code they provide, or (v) help write code. We deployed CodeAid in a large introductory C and Systems Programming course, spanning a 12-week semester, with about 700 university students. During the first half of the course, we analyzed usage data and provided weekly reports to the course instructor. Halfway through the course, we made several updates to the as- sistant based on this feedback.",

This is especially true in computing education, given that code-generating tools are becoming widely adopted in industry practice. This has led to ongoing discussions about the need to change how computing is taught [ 14]. Instructor opinion on this matter is currently divided. Lau and Guo [ 30] interviewed 20 in- troductory programming instructors to understand how they plan to adapt their courses. The authors found that in the short term, many educators planned to discourage \"AI-assisted cheating\" by banning and increasing the weighting of invigilated exam scores, while others are more willing to embrace AI tools by integrating them into their classes. Recent work in the computer science education community has started to explore the implications and opportunities of LLMs on computer science learning from different perspectives [ 3].",

Similarly, Savelka et al. compared the capabilities of GPT-3 and GPT-4 on 599 programming exercises from three Python programming courses and found that the GPT models evolved from completely failing the typical programming class’ assessments (the original GPT-3) CodeAid: Design and Semester-Long Deployment of an LLM-based Programming Assistant CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA to passing the courses with no human involvement (GPT-4) [ 54]. In terms of generating learning resources, early work by Sarsa et al. [53] analyzed the novelty, plausibility, and readiness of 120 pro- gramming exercises generated by OpenAI Codex and proposed the potential of using such models to come up with coding assignments. In contrast, we explore the use of LLMs to help students complete programming exercises without providing direct code solutions.",

Moreover, not all students feel equally comfortable approaching an instructor or teaching assistant for help, which can lead to inequity in comput- ing classrooms [ 18]. The prospect of providing LLM-based support for answering student questions is therefore of great interest to educators [ 29]. In recent work, Liffiton et al. describe initial work in this direction with their CodeHelp tool which provides assis- tance to programming students but employs guardrails to avoid directly revealing solutions [ 37]. Students using CodeHelp can en- ter a free-form question into a text area, along with code and an optional error message. They found that students using CodeHelp over a semester-long programming course (52 students) valued the on-demand availability of the tool, but mostly found it useful for answering specific code-related tasks such as fixing errors.",

For example, ‘explain in plain English’ questions prompt students to explain their understanding of code at an abstract level [ 62], and provides both long-term and short-term learning benefits [ 45,59]. Modelling explanations created by ex- perts is an effective way for students to develop this important skill, however, generating high-quality explanations for a large quantity of varying code fragments represents a significant workload for instructors [39].",

[ 33] showed that LLMs can generate code explanations that are more accurate and easier to understand than those created by students themselves, thus providing a potential scalable solution when compared to peer- generated approaches. CodeAid enhances this by allowing students to ask questions directly from their code to gain clarity on specificconcepts, while also offering an interactive feature for line-by-line code explanations. 2.4 Writing and Debugging Code The ability to write code has been a traditionally important learn- ing outcome for novices in introductory programming courses. A common approach for the development of code writing skills has been through the use of frequent programming practice with many small problems [ 1,13].",

Recent work has shown that LLMs have the potential to be used to assist in many aspects of debugging, including producing more understandable programming error mes- sages [ 34] and providing high-precision feedback on code for fixing syntax errors [49]. CodeAid uses a similar, high-precision method for feedback generation, but also tries to improve the experience by visually annotating the erroneous sections of students’ code with suggestions for corrections.

One key finding was that students frequently copied the exercise questions as prompts and then used the AI-generated code without making any alterations to it. This reliance on the code generator is suggestive of the over-dependency problem [ 9–11]. To address this, CodeAid integrates guardrails to restrict the open- ended AI system from generating direct code solutions even if stu- dents ask for them. Additionally, it uses scaffolding techniques like interactive pseudo-code and code annotations to support students in transitioning from understanding concepts to independently writing and debugging their code. 3 INITIAL SYSTEM DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE CodeAid is an LLM-based programming assistant which aims to assist with programming assignments and reinforce concepts, simi- lar to a teaching assistant, as outlined by Mirza et al [ 44].",

A primary data source for understanding students’ usage patterns (RQ1) and the assis- tant’s response quality (RQ2), was CodeAid’s activity logs. Log data has become an important data source to understand programming experiences [ 6] and coding approaches [ 17,25], particularly when interacting with LLMs [ 27,28]. For each question asked by students, we closely examined its content and CodeAid’s generated responses through a thematic analysis described later in this section. To better understand the usefulness of the AI-generated responses (RQ2), CodeAid prompted students with a mandatory question that asked \"How useful was this response?\" . Students had to respond to a 5- point Likert scale (displayed as a rating stars) and optionally type a reason for their rating before they could use the system again. For each feature, we analyzed the ratings and grouped the reasons into positive and negative feedback to better understand students’ perceptions. 4.3.2 Weekly Research Surveys. To understand how students used CodeAid in comparison to traditional educational resources and ChatGPT (RQ3), we conducted a weekly online survey.",

To gain deeper in- sights about how students used CodeAid (RQ3), we conducted confi- dential interviews with 22 randomly selected participants, ensuring their privacy from the instructors. Eight interviews were conducted halfway through the course (after students had used CodeAid for A1 and A2), and 14 interviews were done after the course was finished (after their final exams). After obtaining informed consent, our in- terview questions addressed productivity enhancement, shifts in workflow, verifying responses and reliability, usability concerns, learning moments with CodeAid, and contrasts with alternative resources like StackOverflow, a moderated Q&A discussion board, and other websites.",

Since course policy prohib- ited the use of code generated from AI tools like ChatGPT to com- plete any course work, we conducted an anonymous survey to determine whether and why students used ChatGPT. Our goal was to gain a holistic view of students’ perceptions of AI assistants in large classes (RQ3). The survey further explored the frequency of their engagement with ChatGPT in comparison to CodeAid. 4.4 Thematic Analysis To gain deeper insights into how students interacted with CodeAid and the quality of the AI-generated responses, we performed a thematic analysis on the usage logs.

During this step, they presented the codes and representative usages to the course instructor and incorporated their feedback. To enhance the generalizability and reliability of our findings, we streamlined our coding definitions. For instance, responses with minor inaccuracies were labelled as \"incorrect\" . Similarly, if responses that were categorized as \"correct\" failed to adequately address the query, were irrelevant, repetitive, or exceeded the scope of the course material, they were labelled as \"unhelpful\" . After refining the codebook 1, the two researchers independently coded 200 data points and used Cohen’s Kappa and percentage agreement [ 43,47] to compute the inter-rater reliability for each of the sub-dimensions.",

This feedback was used to derive any needed iterations to the design of the tool. The feedback highlighted numerous aspects of CodeAid that students appreciated: clear explanations of code or complex top- ics, assistance in identifying errors, constant availability, direct and personalized engagement compared to online searches and documentation, and the flexibility to ask diverse questions. How- ever, our analysis also pinpointed several areas where CodeAid could be improved. Specifically, students felt that the responses they received were often too brief and lacked in-depth informa- tion, example usage code, or associated documentation.",

Furthermore, students expressed the need to ask follow-up questions beyond the \"General Question\" feature. Lastly, during the co-design phase of our interviews, students emphasized the need for seamless access to documentation for functions mentioned in CodeAid’s responses.5.1 System Updates and Enhancements In response to the feedback received during our initial evaluation, and after in-depth discussions with the course instructor, we im- plemented several updates to CodeAid. 5.1.1 Pseudo-Code Integration. As a way to provide more com- prehensive responses and to increase engagement, we decided to add pseudo-code generation to most of the features (Figure 4b). We used pseudo-code as a form of scaffolding, offering a simpli- fied and structured outline of a program, which serves as a bridge to actual coding without directly revealing the code itself [ 32].",

This was then parsed and only the pseudo-code was rendered, while the explanation would be displayed whenever the user hovers over that particular line. 5.1.2 Displaying Function Documentation. Since the Inline Code Exploration was underutilized, we removed it and instead updated all of the features to display static (non-AI generated) documenta- tion for functions that were relevant to the query. Students could hover over the function buttons to see the detailed documentation with usage descriptions and code examples (Figure 4d). We imple- mented this by asking the LLM to always list all relevant functions to the user’s query. To retrieve the documentation for each function, we developed a local key-value database in which the keys were function names and values were the documentation objects scraped from the Standard C Library parsed into a JSON object.",

To achieve this, we developed a specific markup for each of the features to enable parsing the partially generated response as it was being streamed. This enabled our system to immediately start displaying responses after users clicked the generate button. For single-line components such as generating a short summary for the provided code, or responding with a single-line answer to an asked question, our markup used the following format: [output-name]: <text> . For multi-line components such as code parts, we used two to- kens, [start-of-part] and [end-of-part] . Furthermore, in situ- ations where the output of one LLM function was sent to another LLM function in series (e.g. to generate the final pseudo-code from code), our API did not show the generated code, but displayed (and updated while streaming) the number of lines of code that were generated. 5.1.4 Updated Prompts and OpenAI Model.",

The primary reason was a perceived \"lack of need, \" as many found existing course materials \"sufficient\" or the coursework easy. Some were either unaware of CodeAid or forgot to use it. Students also cited a preference for existing resources like GDB debugger, Stack Overflow, and Q&A discussion boards. A few favoured ChatGPT’s GPT-4 version for its ease and versatility. Personal desire for self- reliance was also a reason, with statements like \"I enjoy finding solutions by myself\" . Skepticism towards AI-generated content and past negative experiences also reduced trust in the tool.

While T5 didn’t see ChatGPT as a significant issue for advanced Computer Science courses, there was a general agreement about its potential threat to introductory programming classes. Notably, T1 mentioned \"I would encourage students to use a tool that respects that there’s a learner at the other end, not ChatGPT\" . 7.1.1 General Impressions.

Furthermore, T2 envisioned that CodeAid can greatly assist students in a flipped classroom setting, help students arrive at class more prepared, offer moments for self-reflection on lecture material, and support them in tackling assignments. 7.1.2 Perceptions on Pseudo-Code Usage. Most educators appreci- ated the design of the pseudo-code feature, especially the line-by- line on-hover explanations. T6 liked the way it \"provides structure\" without \"giving away the difficulty of the syntax. \" Similarly, T2 and T4 mentioned how it reduces cognitive load by focusing on overall CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Kazemitabaar, et al. logic.

T3 raised concerns about students \"trusting whatever the AI says\" . T1 suggested that these tools should \"build up students’ ability to critique\" LLM-generated responses. As a solution, T1 and T3 suggested including mandatory tutorials with quizzes before students can use CodeAid. T5 asked for more transparency by having CodeAid display recent incorrect responses for each of the features. T3 mentioned that the inaccuracies of the Help Fix Code feature could mislead students by highlighting incorrect lines, and suggested the feature could instead highlight potentially in- correct lines and ask self-reflective questions from students like \"Are you sure this line is doing [X]?",

A recurrent theme centred on the importance of customization by instructors. Both T3 and T4 emphasized the need for instructors to have control over the types of responses generated by CodeAid for different types of questions. Specifically, T3 wanted CodeAid to produce pseudo-code only for implementation questions, and to merely offer hints for problem- solving questions. On the other hand, T4 wanted to control when pseudo-code was displayed and only enable it at the beginning ofthe course.

Similar features should be built within future tools. Considering the rapidly expanding ecosystem of productivity- focused AI tools, it is challenging to keep students in a learner- centric AI tool. To address this issue, our results suggest designing course-specific AI assistants, for example using approaches such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to allow specific contextual information to be included in model responses [ 35].
